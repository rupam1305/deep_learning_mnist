Classifying MNIST digits using Convolutional Neural Networks
In this project, I show how TensorFlow can be used to implement ANN. Also, I briefly introduce basic concepts of ANN. The mathematical notations and its mapping TensowFlow graphs can be seen at below. The accuracy of this model for Kaggle competition: 0.99

MNIST dataset


The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
